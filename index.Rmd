## Greenplum Database is now open source
  
<br/>
<br/>
  
1. Visit [http://greenplum.org](http://greenplum.org). There is a link to get a sandbox VM with pretty much everything installed.  

2. View the code repository at [https://github.com/greenplum-db/gpdb](https://github.com/greenplum-db/gpdb)  

3. Get the documentation from [http://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io](http://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io)  

4. Subscribe to the mailing lists if you want to remain informed about all recent changes or proposed changes.  

5. Contribute!

## Greenplum as MPP

Everything is distributed to multiple servers. Scalability is linear to number of servers.    

  1. Data  
    i. More data storage (Big Data)  
    ii. Faster read and write performance compared to a centralized storage system ike SAN.
  
  2. Processing  
    i. Distributed Data Load   
    ii. Distributed query Processing  
    iii. Even within a single server, data is processed in parallel to acheieve faster processing  
    iv. Query Processor ensures that bulk of the processing happen independently in servers
  
  3. Database Management  
    i. Parallel / Distributed backup and restore  
    ii. Parallel / Distributed Table analysis and space management  
    iii. Pararrel / Distributed server administration through gpssh and gpscp

## Greenplum Server Architecture

1. 2 Master Servers, N segment servers all connected through private high speed network (10GBPS)  
2. The master server is the interface to the external world. A user connects to the master and submits queries (SQLs) to the master. The standby master server acts as a failover server for the master.  
3. The master server runs a single PostgreSQL database.
4. Each of the N segment servers run 2M segment databases, M primary and M mirror databases. Each primary segment database (NM of them) has a corresponding mirror database that resides on a different server. The mirroring happens in real time so they are always synchronized. If / When a segment server fails, the corresponding mirror databases take over so the system runs.  
5. For the DCA V1 Greenplum appliances running at IRS, N = 16, M = 6. For the new DCA V2s, M = 8.  
6. The Greenplum Database Architecture is explained in detail in [Official Greenplum Documentation](http://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io/4360/admin_guide/intro/arch_overview.html)
